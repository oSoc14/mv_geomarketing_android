mv_geomarketing_android
=======================

###Concept application KUPON

It’s geomarketing at it’s best. Let me walk you through the app. So imagine… You’re on the hunt for a new T-shirt. You open the app and a map appears with all the coupons in the area. Next filter the coupons by selecting a category. Then you’ll see that for example H&M offers an awesome discount on their summer collection. You just walk into the store and use the coupon to get the discount.

###How to run

Import this project in Android studio.
Add play-services and make an development id for google maps
QR-code library ZXing is needed

###Notes

As it is a concept app, the focus is on how the user interact with the app. So the data stored in the local SQLite database is staticaly imported.
